Welcome to History.js (v1.7.0 - April 01 2011)
==================


This project is the successor of [jQuery History](http://balupton.com/projects/jquery-history), it aims to:

- Follow the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) as much as possible
- Provide a cross-compatible experience for all HTML5 Browsers (they all implement the HTML5 History API a little bit differently causing different behaviours and sometimes bugs - History.js fixes this ensuring the experience is as expected / the same / great throughout the HTML5 browsers)
- Provide a backwards-compatible experience for all HTML4 Browsers using a hash-fallback (including continued support for the HTML5 History API's `data`, `title`, `pushState` and `replaceState`) with the option to [remove HTML4 support if it is not right for your application](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)
- Provide a forwards-compatible experience for HTML4 States to HTML5 States (so if a hash-fallbacked url is accessed by a HTML5 browser it is naturally transformed into its non-hashed url equivalent)
- Provide support for as many javascript frameworks as possible via adapters; especially [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [MooTools](http://mootools.net/), [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/)

## Usage

### Working with History.js:

	(function(window,undefined){

		// Prepare
		var History = window.History; // Note: We are using a capital H instead of a lower h
		if ( !History.enabled ) {
			 // History.js is disabled for this browser.
			 // This is because we can optionally choose to support HTML4 browsers or not.
			return false;
		}

		// Bind to StateChange Event
		History.Adapter.bind(window,'statechange',function(){ // Note: We are using statechange instead of popstate
			var State = History.getState(); // Note: We are using History.getState() instead of event.state
			History.log(State.data, State.title, State.url);
		});

		// Change our States
		History.pushState({state:1}, "State 1", "?state=1"); // logs {state:1}, "State 1", "?state=1"
		History.pushState({state:2}, "State 2", "?state=2"); // logs {state:2}, "State 2", "?state=2"
		History.replaceState({state:3}, "State 3", "?state=3"); // logs {state:3}, "State 3", "?state=3"
		History.pushState(null, null, "?state=4"); // logs {}, '', "?state=4"
		History.back(); // logs {state:3}, "State 3", "?state=3"
		History.back(); // logs {state:1}, "State 1", "?state=1"
		History.back(); // logs {}, "Home Page", "?"
		History.go(2); // logs {state:3}, "State 3", "?state=3"

	})(window);

To ajaxify your entire website with the HTML5 History API, History.js and jQuery [this snippet of code](https://gist.github.com/854622) is all you need. It's that easy.

### How would the above operations look in a HTML5 Browser?

1. www.mysite.com
1. www.mysite.com/?state=1
1. www.mysite.com/?state=2
1. www.mysite.com/?state=3
1. www.mysite.com/?state=4
1. www.mysite.com/?state=3
1. www.mysite.com/?state=1
1. www.mysite.com
1. www.mysite.com/?state=3

> Note: These urls also work in HTML4 browsers and Search Engines. So no need for the hashbang (`#!`) fragment-identifier that google ["recommends"](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling).

### How would they look in a HTML4 Browser?

1. www.mysite.com
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=1&_suid=1
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=2&_suid=2
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=3&_suid=3
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=4
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=3&_suid=3
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=1&_suid=1
1. www.mysite.com
1. www.mysite.com/#?state=3&_suid=3

> Note 1: These urls also work in HTML5 browsers - we use `replaceState` to transform these HTML4 states into their HTML5 equivalents so the user won't even notice :-)
>
> Note 2: These urls will be automatically url-encoded in IE6 to prevent certain browser-specific bugs.
>
> Note 3: Support for HTML4 browsers (this hash fallback) is optional [- why supporting HTML4 browsers could be either good or bad based on my app's use cases](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)

### What's the deal with the SUIDs used in the HTML4 States?

- SUIDs (State Unique Identifiers) are used when we utilise a `title` and/or `data` in our state. Adding a SUID allows us to associate particular states with data and titles while keeping the urls as simple as possible (don't worry it's all tested, working and a lot smarter than I'm making it out to be).
- If you aren't utilising `title` or `data` then we don't even include a SUID (as there is no need for it) - as seen by State 4 above :-)
- We also shrink the urls to make sure that the smallest url will be used. For instance we will adjust `http://www.mysite.com/#http://www.mysite.com/projects/History.js` to become `http://www.mysite.com/#/projects/History.js` automatically. (again tested, working, and smarter).
- It works with domains, subdomains, subdirectories, whatever - doesn't matter where you put it. It's smart.
- Safari 5 will also have a SUID appended to the URL, it is entirely transparent but just a visible side-effect. It is required to fix a bug with Safari 5.

### Is there a working demo?

- Sure is, give it a download and navigate to the demo directory in your browser :-)
- If you are after something a bit more adventurous than a end-user demo, open up the tests directory in your browser and editor - it'll rock your world and show all the vast use cases that History.js supports.


## Download & Installation

1. Download History.js and upload it to your webserver. Download links: [tar.gz](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/tarball/master) or [zip](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/zipball/master)

2. Include [JSON2](http://www.json.org/js.html) for HTML4 Browsers Only *(replace www.yourwebsite.com)*

		<script>if ( typeof window.JSON === 'undefined' ) { document.write('<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/json2.js"><\/script>'); }</script>

3. Include [Amplify.js Store](http://amplifyjs.com/) for Data Persistance and Synchronisation Support (optional but recommended)

		<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/amplify.store.js"></script>

4. Include the Adapter for your Framework:

	- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) v1.3+

			<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/history.adapter.jquery.js"></script>

	- [Mootools](http://mootools.net/) v1.3+

			<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/history.adapter.mootools.js"></script>

	- [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) v1.7+ (does not support versions of IE prior to 9 due to a bug in the prototype library)

			<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/history.adapter.prototype.js"></script>

	- [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) v0.5+

			<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/history.adapter.zepto.js"></script>

	- _Would you like to support another framework? No problem! It's very easy to create adapters, and I'll be happy to include them or help out if you [let me know](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues) :-)_

5. Include History.js

		<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/history.js"></script>
		<script src="http://www.yourwebsite.com/history.js/scripts/compressed/history.html4.js"></script>

> Note: If you want to only support HTML5 Browsers and not HTML4 Browsers (so no hash fallback support) then just remove the `history.html4.js` file include in step #5 and the JSON2 (`json2.js`) file include in step #2 [- why supporting HTML4 browsers could be either good or bad based on my app's use cases](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)

- Firefox 3
- Opera 10,11

## Exposed API

### Functions

- `History.pushState(data,title,url)` <br/> Pushes a new state to the browser; `data` can be null or an object, `title` can be null or a string, `url` must be a string
- `History.replaceState(data,title,url)` <br/> Replaces the existing state with a new state to the browser; `data` can be null or an object, `title` can be null or a string, `url` must be a string
- `History.getState()` <br/> Gets the current state of the browser, returns an object with `data`, `title` and `url`
- `History.getHash()` <br/> Gets the current hash of the browser
- `History.Adapter.bind(element,event,callback)` <br/> A framework independent event binder, you may either use this or your framework's native event binder.
- `History.Adapter.trigger(element,event)` <br/> A framework independent event trigger, you may either use this or your framework's native event trigger.
- `History.Adapter.onDomLoad(callback)` <br/> A framework independent onDomLoad binder, you may either use this or your framework's native onDomLoad binder.
- `History.back()` <br/> Go back once through the history (same as hitting the browser's back button)
- `History.forward()` <br/> Go forward once through the history (same as hitting the browser's forward button)
- `History.go(X)` <br/> If X is negative go back through history X times, if X is positive go forwards through history X times
- `History.log(...)` <br/> Logs messages to the console, the log element, and fallbacks to alert if neither of those two exist
- `History.debug(...)` <br/> Same as `History.log` but only runs if `History.debug.enable === true`

### Events

- `window.onstatechange` <br/> Fired when the state of the page changes (does not include hash changes)
- `window.onanchorchange` <br/> Fired when the anchor of the page changes (does not include state hashes)


## Notes on Compatibility

- History.js **solves** the following browser bugs:
	- HTML5 Browsers
		- Chrome 8 sometimes does not contain the correct state data when traversing back to the initial state
		- Safari 5, Safari iOS 4 and Firefox 3 and 4 do not fire the `onhashchange` event when the page is loaded with a hash
		- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 do not fire the `onpopstate` event when the hash has changed unlike the other browsers
		- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 fail to return to the correct state once a hash is replaced by a `replaceState` call / [bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56249)
		- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 sometimes fail to apply the state change under busy conditions / [bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42940)
		- Google Chrome 8,9,10 and Firefox 4 prior to the RC will always fire `onpopstate` once the page has loaded / [change recommendation](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/history-api-changes-in-firefox-4/)
		- Safari iOS 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 have a working HTML5 History API - although the actual back buttons of the browsers do not work, therefore we treat them as HTML4 browsers
		- None of the HTML5 browsers actually utilise the `title` argument to the `pushState` and `replaceState` calls
	- HTML4 Browsers
		- Old browsers like MSIE 6,7 and Firefox 2 do not have a `onhashchange` event
		- MSIE 6 and 7 sometimes do not apply a hash even it was told to (requiring a second call to the apply function)
		- Non-Opera HTML4 browsers sometimes do not apply the hash when the hash is not `urlencoded`
	- All Browsers
		- State data and titles do not persist once the site is left and then returned (includes page refreshes)
		- State titles are never applied to the `document.title`
- ReplaceState functionality is emulated in HTML4 browsers by discarding the replaced state, so when the discarded state is accessed it is skipped using the appropriate `History.back()` / `History.forward()` call
- Data persistance and synchronisation works like so: Every second or so, the SUIDs and URLs of the states will synchronise between the store and the local session. When a new session opens a familiar state (via the SUID or the URL) and it is not found locally then it will attempt to load the last known stored state with that information.
- URLs will be unescaped to the maximum, so for instance the URL `?key=a%20b%252c` will become `?key=a b c`. This is to ensure consistency between browser url encodings.
- Changing the hash of the page causes `onpopstate` to fire (this is expected/standard functionality). To ensure correct compatibility between HTML5 and HTML4 browsers the following events have been created:
	- `window.onstatechange`: this is the same as the `onpopstate` event except it does not fire for traditional anchors
	- `window.onanchorchange`: this is the same as the `onhashchange` event except it does not fire for states
- Known Issues
	- Opera 11 fails to create history entries when under stressful loads (events fire perfectly, just the history events fail) - there is nothing we can do about this
	- Mercury iOS fails to apply url changes (hashes and HTML5 History API states) - there is nothing we can do about this


## Changelog

- v1.7.0 - April 01 2011
	- Added `History.enabled` property (refer to usage section). This reflects whether or not History.js is enabled for our particular browser. For instance, if we have not included support for a HTML4 browser and we are accessing through a HTML4 browser then `History.enabled` will be `false`.
	- Added (optional but recommended) Data Persistance and Synchronisation Support thanks to [AppendTo's](http://appendto.com/) [Amplify.js](http://amplifyjs.com/) (refer to installation and compatibility sections for details)
	- Made HTML5 SUIDs more transparent - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/issues#issue/34) by [azago](https://github.com/azago) and [Mark Jaquith](http://markjaquith.com/)
	- Fixed Session Storage Issue - Reported by a whole bunch of different people; [one](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/issues#issue/36), [two](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/issues#issue/37), [three](http://getsatisfaction.com/balupton/topics/history_js_1_6_losing_state_after_manual_page_reload)
	- Fixed URL Encoding Issue - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues/#issue/33) by [Rob Madole](http://robmadole.com/)
	- Disabled support for IE6,7,8 when using the Prototype Adapter (there is nothing we can do about this, it is due to a bug in the prototype library) - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues#issue/39) by [Sindre Wimberger](http://sindre.at/)
	- URLs in the State Hashes for HTML4 Browsers are now even shorter - [Discussion](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues#issue/28)
	- Fixed a issue with the MooTools Adapter and JSON with IE7 and IE8

- v1.6.0 - March 22 2011
	- Added Zepto adapter thanks to [Matt Garrett](http://twitter.com/#!/matthewgarrett)
	- The readme now references the supported versions of the libraries we use
	- Updated vendors to the most recent versions. jQuery 1.5.1 and Mootools 1.3.1
	- Reverted versions of Safari iOS prior to version 4.3 to be HTML4 browsers, Safari iOS 4.3 is a HTML5 browser
	- Refined code in History.js and its adapters
	- Fixed issue with extra state being inserted on Safari 5 requiring an extra click on the back button to go home - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues#issue/17) by [Rob Madole](http://robmadole.com/)
	- Fixed issue with Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 sometimes failing to apply the state change under busy conditions - Solution conceived with [Matt Garrett](http://twitter.com/matthewgarrett)
	- Fixed issue with HTML4 browsers requiring a query-string in the urls of states - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues#issue/26) by [azago](https://github.com/azago)
	- Fixed issue with HTML4 browsers requiring title in the states in order to use state data - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues#issue/25) by [Jonathan McLaughlin](http://system-werks.com/)
	- Fixed issue with HTML4 browsers failing is a state is pushed/replaced twice in a row - [Reported](https://github.com/balupton/history.js/issues#issue/17) by [Joey Baker](http://byjoeybaker.com/)
	- **B/C BREAK:** The `statechange` event now only fires if the state has changed; it no longer fires on page initialisation. This is following the [Firefox 4 History API Changes](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/history-api-changes-in-firefox-4/) which we agree with - this breaks standard, but makes more sense.

- v1.5.0 - February 12 2011

## Todo for Upcoming Releases

- Allow for url to be optional in `pushState` and `replaceState` calls
- Add an Ajax extension to succeed the [jQuery Ajaxy](http://balupton.com/projects/jquery-ajaxy) project
- Add a compilation test to ensure `.debug = false` and no `History.log` or `console.xxx` calls exist.

It's likely these features and/or others have been included in the latest [dev branch](https://github.com/balupton/History.js/tree/dev). If you are wanting to fork and help out, then be sure to work on the dev branch and not master.
